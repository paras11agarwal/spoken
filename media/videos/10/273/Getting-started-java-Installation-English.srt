00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Getting started with Java Installation.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
In this tutorial, we will learn:

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
To install the JDK using Synaptic Package Manager.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
Why Java? Types and applications of Java.

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:18
Here we are using:

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
Ubuntu version 11.10 and

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
Java Development Environment JDK 1.6 .

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
To follow this tutorial, you must be connected to the internet.

9
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
You must have Synaptic Package Manager installed on your system.

10
00:00:35 --> 00:00:42
You must also have knowledge of using Terminal, Text Editor and Synaptic Package Manager in Linux.

11
00:00:43 --> 00:00:50
If not, please see the Spoken Tutorial on Linux, available at spoken-tutorial.org.

12
00:00:51 --> 00:00:56
To run a java program we need to install the JDK, the Java Development Kit.

13
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
To learn more about JDK, you could visit the following link:

14
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
Now we will install the JDK using Synaptic Package Manager.

15
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
For this, you need to have root permissions.

16
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
You also need to know how to choose a repository.

17
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
These are explained in the prerequisite tutorial on Linux, mentioned earlier.

18
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
Now, on the left corner of your Desktop, you will find the Taskbar.

19
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
At the top you will find DashHome.

20
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
Click on DashHome.

21
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
In the search bar, type Synaptic.

22
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
You will find Synaptic Package Manager here.

23
00:01:38 --> 00:01:41
Click on Synaptic Package Manager.

24
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
You will be asked to type your password for Authentication.

25
00:01:47 --> 00:01:55
So, type your password and click on Authenticate.

26
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
This opens the Synaptic Package Manager.

27
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
Now In the Quick Filter box, type jdk.

28
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
We see a package named openjdk-6-jdk.

29
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
Right click on it and click on Mark for Installation.

30
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Then click on Apply.

31
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
You will be asked to confirm the list of marked changes.

32
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
So click on To be Installed and then click on Apply.

33
00:02:30 --> 00:02:37
The installation will take a few seconds.

34
00:02:38 --> 00:02:47
Now we see that the option openjdk-6-jdk is in green colour.

35
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
Thus our installation is complete.

36
00:02:52 --> 00:03:02
Now, let us verify the installation. For this, open the terminal by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously.

37
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
I already have my terminal opened here.

38
00:03:06 --> 00:03:14
At the command prompt, type: java space hyphen version and press Enter.

39
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
We see that the version number of the 'jdk has been displayed.

40
00:03:20 --> 00:03:25
Depending on the distribution  that you used your version number could be different.

41
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
So, we have successfully installed the jdk.

42
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
Now, let us run a simple Java program and see if it works.

43
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
I already have the following code, saved in the file name TestProgram dot java.

44
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
Now, let me compile and run this code.

45
00:03:45 --> 00:03:52
This code simply displays We have successfully run a Java Program on the Terminal.

46
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
So, let us go back to the Terminal.

47
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
Remember that I have saved the file TestProgram dot java in the Home directory.

48
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
And currently I am in the Home Directory.

49
00:04:07 --> 00:04:18
So, at the command prompt, type: javac space TestProgram dot java.

50
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
This is to compile the code.

51
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
Press Enter.

52
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
Now, let me run the code.

53
00:04:27 --> 00:04:34
So, type: java space TestProgram and press Enter.

54
00:04:35 --> 00:04:43
We get the output as We have successfully run a java program.

55
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
Thus, our installation has been perfect.

56
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
Now, let us go back to the slides.

57
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
I will now explain why Java is useful.

58
00:04:55 --> 00:04:56
Java is simple.

59
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
Java is object oriented.

60
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
It is platform independent.

61
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
It is safe. Java has high performance.

62
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
Java is multiÃ¢threaded.

63
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
We will now go through some types and applications of Java.

64
00:05:11 --> 00:05:17
JSP, or Java Server Pages: It is based on a code with normal HTML tags.

65
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
JSP helps in creating dynamic web pages.

66
00:05:22 --> 00:05:27
Java Applets: It is used to provide interactive features to web applications.

67
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
J2EE or Java Enterprise Edition: Companies use J2EE.

68
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
It is useful to transfer XML structured documents.

69
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
JavaBeans: JavaBeans is a reusable software component.

70
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
It can be used to build new and advanced applications.

71
00:05:47 --> 00:05:52
Mobile Java: It is used for various entertainment devices, such as mobile phone.

72
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
So, in this tutorial we learnt:

73
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
To install the JDK using Synaptic Package Manager.

74
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
To compile and run a Java program.
